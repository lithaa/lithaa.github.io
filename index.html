            <p>Litha Ashforth, soprano, is known for her “spellbinding” presence on stage. Her work spans operatic
                vocals, sacred dance, haptics, custom software, and field recordings. A recipient of numerous
                competitive honors, she has been distinguished in competition by the Performing Arts Scholarship
                Foundation at the Music Academy of the West, the Maestro Award from World Strides Heritage Festival, and
                is a recipient of the Dean’s Scholarship at the New England Conservatory of Music.<br><br>



                Litha has been performing since her preschool graduation. Most recently, she performed with the Boston
                Symphony Orchestra, and was a featured soloist at the Tournament of Roses, Music on Norway Pond
                Festival, Judson Memorial Church in NYC, and the Vietnam War Memorial. Her credits in opera, musical
                theatre, and film are numerous. This spring, she starred as Adele in Die Fledermaus at the Plimpton
                Shattuck Black Box Theatre, and depicted the lead role in the world premiere of Order: A Play by Anna
                Abondolo and Jon Starks.<br><br>



                Litha is also passionate about leadership, education, and activism. She currently serves as Student Body
                President and founder of the Student Embassy at the New England Conservatory. As an activist, she works
                with organizations including Harvard Street Team and Judson Bail Out to provide necessary resources for
                people experiencing homelessness, and aids such organizations in creating public concerts. Litha
                currently teaches music programming under the direction of Walter Bender, the former director of the MIT
                Media Lab. As a part of this work, she has developed implementations for bioacoustics pedagogy within
                Music Blocks, Bender’s in-development programming language for music education.<br><br>



                Her work as a composer addresses technology, ancestral memory, and bioacoustics. Her most recent piece,
                “Shadow Kick” premiered May 2022 in Jordan Hall.</p>
